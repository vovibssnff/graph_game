# graph_game
Cops go through the graph using BFS, robbers move using Dijkstra's algorithm. BFS and Dijkstra are connected to the server, which logs the current location of each fraction. Clients print location as well.
Client-server architecture is implemented with the help of multiprocessing. 
To execute, open 3 terminals, launch server first and other files simultaniously. To customize destination vertexes, check out func calls. GL!
